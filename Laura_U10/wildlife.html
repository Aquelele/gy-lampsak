		  <h2>Rare Macaroni Penguins</h2> <a id="pingu"></a>
		  <p>Very similar looking to Rockhoppers, witnessing Macaroni penguins during our Antarctica trip 
		  was a special treat, because they can often be difficult to find. Macaronis prefer to nest on very 
		  remote and exposed rock outcroppings that are challenging for humans to reach.
		  Luckily our ship’s wildlife expert happened to discover a colony, and we used our zodiac boats to
		  maneuver in close. They were named “Macaroni” after the 18th-century English fashion of 
		  wearing outlandish clothing & wigs!</p>

		  <h2>Chinstrap Penguins</h2> <a id="Seals"></a>
		  <p>Chinstrap Penguins are named after the black neckband that makes it look like they’re always grinning.
		  These little penguins can be found most often near the Antarctic coastline, but will also hitch a ride out on 
		  icebergs floating into the middle of the sea.
		  You can always tell which penguins are taking care of the nest, and which have just returned from hunting 
		  in the ocean by how dirty they are. This group has obviously been on nest duty for a while!</p>

		  <h2>Blood thirsty Ducks</h2> <a id="Wateranimals"></a>
		  <p>Meet the South Georgia Pintail, a small & curious duck that calls the sub antarctic region home.
		  Yes a duck! And not just any duck, this thing has an appetite for raw meat. Along with algae, it eats 
		  shrimp, clams, snails, and likes to pick through the dead carcasses of seals.
		  
		  South Georgia Pintails were once threatened by the introduction of rats to the island which often ate 
		  their eggs, as well as whale hunters who would eat the birds themselves. They’ve made a comeback
		  though, now that whaling is illegal on and around South Georgia.</p>

		  <h2>Chinstrap Penguins</h2>
		  <p>The chinstrap penguin is a species of penguin that inhabits a variety of islands and shores in the
		  Southern Pacific and the Antarctic Oceans. Its name stems from the narrow black band under its head,
		  which makes it appear as if it were wearing a black helmet, making it easy to identify.</p>

		  <h2>Arctic fox</h2>
		  <p>This beaurty. The Arctic fox, also known as the white fox, polar fox, or snow fox, is a small fox
		  native to the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere and common throughout the Arctic tundra biome.
		  It is well adapted to living in cold environments, and is best known for its thick, warm fur that is
		  also used as camouflage. </p>
